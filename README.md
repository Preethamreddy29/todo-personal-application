## todo-application-personal ##

## Project Overview

This project is a full-stack To-Do application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). The application allows users to add, mark as complete, and delete tasks from their to-do list. It features a clean and intuitive user interface, with task statuses visually represented, ensuring an easy and efficient user experience.

## Backend Development

The backend of the application is powered by Node.js and Express.js. MongoDB is used as the database to store tasks. The backend API manages CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for the tasks, ensuring data is properly stored and retrieved. Mongoose is used for object data modeling, which simplifies the interaction between the Node.js application and the MongoDB database.

## Frontend Development

The frontend is developed using React, a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The application includes state management to handle the dynamic nature of task updates, ensuring the UI reflects changes immediately. The React components are styled to provide a responsive and user-friendly interface. The application also integrates various icons to enhance the user experience.

## Deployment and Version Control

The project is managed and version-controlled using Git and GitHub. The application is deployed locally during the development phase, with all necessary dependencies and configurations documented. The repository contains detailed commit history, allowing for easy tracking of changes and collaborative development. Any issues related to line endings (CRLF vs. LF) have been handled to maintain cross-platform compatibility.
